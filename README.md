# Next Christmas

Like the opposite of the Wham song...get it?  

This is a small test app for experimenting with Next.js.  It's essentially a Christmas list building tool where a user could add items to their list (definitely not a shopping cart though, ok?!).  

In another multiverse, this is fetching product data from an API that's updated with new items instead of reading static data.  And a user's list could probably be shared or exported with loved ones.  But this isn't that universe.
